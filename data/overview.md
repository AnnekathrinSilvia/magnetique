## Overview of *Magnetique* 

*Magnetique* is a user-friendly application to interactively explore data from the Myocardial Applied Genomics Network [MAGNet](https://www.med.upenn.edu/magnet/index.shtml) consortium.

*Magnetique* can be used to identify novel molecular mechanisms associated with cardiomyopathies with potential diagnostics, prognosis and therapeutics values.

*Magnetique* offers:
 - **Gene View**. Explore gene expression, differentially expressed genes, and genes with differential transcript usage for three different contrasts.
 - **Gene Set View**. Explore enriched gene sets accross three different contrasts for three ontologies.
 - **Carnival View**. Explore regulatory networks leading to transcription factor activity for three different contrasts.
 - **Bookmarks**. Save and download genes of interests.

**Study Overview**. Sample information, phenotype, technical covariates, and summary statistics are shown on the right.

## Method

We curated and processed data from the Myocardial Applied Genomics Network [MAGNet](https://www.med.upenn.edu/magnet/index.shtml) consortium, consisting of 
whole-transcriptomes of left ventricle (LV) tissues from end-stage heart failure (HF) patients and due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n=165) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, n=27) and from unmatched non-failing hearts from organ donors (NFD, n=162). Analyses include *(i)* differential gene expression, *(ii)* differential transcript usage, *(iii)* gene set enrichment, and *(iv)* gene regulatory network inference. Please refer to [citation] for a detailed description and further examples.
