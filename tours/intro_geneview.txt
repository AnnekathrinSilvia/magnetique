#welcome;The tour will take you through the relevant elements of the Differential Gene Expression (DGE) and Differential Transcript Usage (DTU) analysis.
#selected_contrast + .selectize-control;You can choose between pairs of conditions you wish to compare: DCMvsHCM, DCMvsNFD and HCMvsNFD.
#de_table;Genes with fold change and significance (*p*-value) for differential gene expression (DGE) and differential transcript usage (DTU). Gene ID links to the Ensembl website. The table header shows details for each column. Select a row to see more information. 
#bookmarker;After selecting a row on the table, bookmark it here to add it to the Bookmarks Section.
#de_volcano;The first volcano plot summarizes the DGE analysis, showing the test statistic (-log10 of *p*-values) versus the magnitude of change (log2-fold-change) of each quantified gene.
#dtu_volcano;The second volcano plot compares the statistical significance (-log10 of adjusted p-values) to the difference in transcript usage.
#gene_counts;Boxplots depicting the distribution of read counts per etiology for the selected gene.
#transcript_proportion;A boxplot showing the fitted transcript proportions of transcripts that were tested for DTU on the selected gene.
#gene_structure;Plots comparing the transcript structure for each selected gene.
