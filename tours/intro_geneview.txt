#welcome;Welcome to the <b>Gene view tour</b> for <code>magnetique</code>
#Step1;The tour will take you 
#tour_geneview; For the welcome page, you can (re)start it with this button
#magnetique_tab;You can navigate to the content of the different tabs by clicking...
#selected_contrast + .selectize-control;selected_contrast info
#selected_ontology + .selectize-control;selected_ontology info
#de_table;Genes with fold change and significance (p-value) for differential gene expression (DGE) and differential transcript usage (DTU), co-expression module and rank (how connected a gene is within a module). Click on a gene to view the DTU results. Click on a gene ID to get more information.

#wgcn_heatmap;Heatmap of the correlation of WGCNA modules (co-expressed gene clusters) with covariates and traits. Significant correlations are indicated with a p-value. Biweight midcorrelation is used (Pearson for binary/discrete variables). Hover over cells to view the correlation. To find the genes that belong to a given module, use the table above (column "module", or search bar).
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the <b>Gene view tour</b> of <code>magnetique</code>!
