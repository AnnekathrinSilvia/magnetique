#welcome;Welcome to the <b>Geneset view tour</b> for <code>Magnetique</code>. The tour will take you through the relevant elements of the Gene Set Analysis.
#selected_contrast + .selectize-control; Here you can choose between pairs of conditions you wish to compare.
#selected_ontology + .selectize-control;Here you can choose between sub-ontologies to show on the Gene Set View: BP for Biological Process, MF for Molecular Function, and CC for Cellular Component.
#number_genesets;You can select the number of significant gene sets to show on the Gene Set View.
#color_by + .selectize-control;You can choose to show the strength of the regulation of a gene set based on the z-normalized enrichment score (z_score) or its significance score (gs_pvalue).
#enrich_table;The Table of Genes Sets indicates the enrichment scores (expected), significance scores (pval), and the number of observed genes that are associated with the gene ontology term (observed). 
#enrich_table;Rows can be filtered by a partial word match or by `filter <= pval` for the pval column.
#enriched_funcres;A plot showing the gene expression (log2 fold change) of genes associated with each Gene Ontology term. You can hover over each dot in the plot in order to visualize the gene ID symbol as well as its regulation value (log2FoldChange).
#visnet_em;The Gene Set Enrichment Network shows the Gene Set Enrichment map, which is used to visualize the results of gene-set enrichment as a network. The size of the circles will be defined by the number of observed genes for each gene ontology term, while the thickness of the edge defines the number of overlapping genes between the gene ontology terms. In the select by id drop-down menu, you can select the gene set to visualize. 
#emap_signature;A heatmap plot shows the expression of the genes associated with the selected gene ontology ID across all the experiments. Gene expression values were used to group experiments together, and each sample was labeled with its own characteristics (etiology, race, sex, age, SV1 and SV2).
