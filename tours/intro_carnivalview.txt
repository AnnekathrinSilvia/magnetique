#welcome;Welcome to the <b>Carnival View</b> tour for <code>magnetique</code>
#Step1;The tour will take you through the relevant elements of the <b> CARNIVAL Analysis</b>.
#Step2; CARNIVAL networks provide a mechanistic overview of regulated interactions between proteins when comparing two experimental conditions. CARNIVAL applies Causal Reasoning principles to infer upstream protein signaling interactions regulating the activities of downstream transcription factors as estimated from the DGE analysis. Nodes in the network represent signaling proteins, while edges indicate the interactions between them. The interactions in CARNIVAL are signed (activatory/suppressing interaction) and so are the nodes (inferred up-regulation/down-regulation of the activity of a protein). The legend on the left provides a description of network elements.
#selected_contrast + .selectize-control; You can choose CARNIVAL views for each pair of conditions you wish to compare: DCMvsHCM, DCMvsNFD and HCMvsNFD.
#nodeSelectvisnet_carnival; Here you can select the protein/gene to highlight on the network.
#visnet_igraph;The green node is a perturbation node. Circles are inferred proteins, and squares transcription factors. Activatory interactions are represented by black lines, and inhibitory interactions by red lines. Activities are colored from -1 (blue, down-regulated) to +1 (red, up-regulated).
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the <b>Carnival View</b> tour of <code>magnetique</code>!
